Video Transformer(VIT): A Deep Learning Model for Video Processing

Video Transformer is a deep learning model that has recently been developed to process and analyze video data. It is based on the transformer architecture that has already proven its effectiveness in NLP tasks. The Video Transformer model can be used for various video processing tasks, such as video classification, video captioning, and video generation.

The fine-tuning code and pre-trained ViT models are available on the GitHub of Google Research. You find them here.

The Video Transformer model is composed of two main components: the spatial transformer and the temporal transformer. The spatial transformer is responsible for processing the spatial information of each frame in the video, while the temporal transformer is responsible for processing the temporal information between frames. These two components work together to provide a comprehensive understanding of the video data.

The spatial transformer consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is used to extract features from each frame. The extracted features are then fed into the self-attention mechanism (intreduced by google in this acrticle) of the transformer architecture. The self-attention mechanism is used to weigh the importance of each feature and produce a more representative feature vector for each frame.

The temporal transformer is similar to the spatial transformer, except that it takes into account the relationships between frames. The temporal transformer uses the same self-attention mechanism as the spatial transformer, but it also includes a temporal attention mechanism that is used to weigh the importance of each frame in the video. This allows the model to focus on the most important frames in the video and ignore redundant or irrelevant frames.

The Video Transformer model can be trained on large datasets of videos and their corresponding labels. During the training process, the model learns to recognize the patterns and relationships in the video data and make predictions based on this information. The trained model can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen video data.

Process:
The Video Transformer process can be divided into the following high-level steps:

Splitting the video into frames: The first step is to split the video into individual frames. This allows the model to process each frame independently and extract features from each frame.
Resizing and normalizing the frames: After the frames are extracted, they are typically resized to a common resolution and normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. This is done to ensure that the model is not biased towards larger or brighter frames.
Splitting each frame into patches: The next step is to split each frame into smaller patches. This allows the model to capture the fine-grained details of the video data and improve its accuracy.
Adding positional encoding: To ensure that the model is aware of the relative position of each patch in the frame, a positional encoding is added to each patch. The positional encoding encodes the relative position of each patch as a set of vectors that are added to the patch’s feature vector.
Feeding the patches into the spatial transformer: The patches are then fed into the spatial transformer, which extracts features from each patch using a CNN and self-attention mechanism.
Concatenating the frames: The features from each frame are then concatenated and fed into the temporal transformer. The temporal transformer processes the temporal relationships between frames using a self-attention mechanism and a temporal attention mechanism.
Adding a classification head: Finally, a classification head is added to the model, which makes predictions based on the processed video data. The classification head typically includes a linear layer and a softmax activation function, which outputs a probability distribution over the possible classes.
Code:
Here is an example implementation of the Video Transformer model in PyTorch:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SpatialTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(SpatialTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        return x

class TemporalTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(TemporalTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=(3, 1, 1), stride=(1, 1, 1), padding=(1, 0, 0))
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm3d(out_channels)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        return x

class VideoTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, spatial_out_channels, temporal_out_channels, num_classes):
        super(VideoTransformer, self).__init__()
CLS:
The classification token (marked in the figure above — *), often referred to as the “CLS” token, is a special token that is added to the input data in the Transformer architecture. It is used to provide a fixed-length representation of the input data for the classification head.

In the case of the Video Transformer, the CLS token is added to the processed video data, which includes the concatenated features from all the frames in the video. The CLS token is then processed by the Transformer along with the other input data, allowing the model to capture the global context of the video and use this information for classification.

The classification head uses the representation of the CLS token to make predictions about the class of the video. The representation of the CLS token is typically passed through a linear layer and a softmax activation function, which outputs a probability distribution over the possible classes.

Now including the CLS token:

class SpatialTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(SpatialTransformer, self).__init__()

        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        return x

class TemporalTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(TemporalTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=(3, 1, 1), stride=(1, 1, 1), padding=(1, 0, 0))
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm3d(out_channels)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        return x

class VideoTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, spatial_out_channels, temporal_out_channels, num_classes):
        super(VideoTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.spatial_transformer = SpatialTransformer(in_channels, spatial_out_channels)
        self.temporal_transformer = TemporalTransformer(spatial_out_channels, temporal_out_channels)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(temporal_out_channels, num_classes)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.spatial_transformer(x)
        x = x.permute(0, 2, 1, 3, 4).contiguous()
        x = self.temporal_transformer(x)
        x = x.mean(dim=1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x
Like all machine learning models, Video Transformers (ViTs) have both advantages and disadvantages when compared to other models.

Advantages:
ViTs can process videos of different lengths and sizes, making them well-suited for video classification tasks.
ViTs are end-to-end models that can learn both spatial and temporal features in videos, allowing them to capture complex relationships between frames.
ViTs can be trained on large amounts of data and fine-tuned on smaller datasets, making them scalable and efficient.
ViTs are designed to handle sequences of data, making them well-suited for video classification tasks.
Disadvantages:
ViTs can be computationally expensive, particularly when processing high-resolution videos with large numbers of frames.
ViTs can be difficult to train and optimize, especially for tasks that require fine-grained predictions.
ViTs are prone to overfitting, particularly when trained on small datasets.
ViTs can be limited by the quality of the input data, particularly when dealing with noisy or low-quality videos.
It’s important to consider the specific use case and requirements when choosing a machine learning model for video classification tasks. ViTs may be a good fit for certain tasks, but other models may be more appropriate for other tasks, depending on the size and quality of the data, the computational resources available, and the desired level of accuracy and performance.
